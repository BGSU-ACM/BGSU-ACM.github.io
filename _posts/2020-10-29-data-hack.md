Welcome!
The 2020 Data Hack will be taking place Nov 16 - Nov 23! We will be learning about coronavirus data and data science. Experience is not required, it is recommended you have taken an introduction to programming course.

Additionally we will be holding an info session on Nov. 2nd and a pre-hack workshop on Nov. 10th to gain some familiarity with Covid data and python tools we will be using. You can use other tools, but these are just recommended.
