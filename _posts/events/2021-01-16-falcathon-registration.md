We are coming up on the second annual Falcathon (hope you all like the new name). This year's Falcathon will be taking place **March 26th through March 28th**. The event will be held online this year so students who aren't on campus this year will also be able to participate.

Another big change is that with the help of our sponsors will will be expanding the event to welcome students from other colleges to participate. The goal of this event is to strengthen the tech community in Northwest Ohio and this is a major step in this direction.

### Registration

Registration is officially open! Thanks to our sponsors we are able to provide this event free of charge. However, if you are unable to make it please remember to cancel your tickets. If you are competing select the participant ticket and if you are a mentor make sure to select the mentor ticket.
