Hi everyone, Spencer here! I am happy that we are coming up on the second annual Falcathon (hope you all like the new name). This year's Falcathon will be taking place **March 26th through March 28th**. The event will be held online this year so students who aren't on campus this year will also be able to participate.

Another big change is that with the help of our sponsors will will be expanding the event to welcome students from other colleges to participate. The goal of this event is to strengthen the tech community in Northwest Ohio and this is a major step in this direction.

### Registration

We will be opening up registration in Feburary. If you want to sign up to get an email when registration opens let me know in the google form below.
