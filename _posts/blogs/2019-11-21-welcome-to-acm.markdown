The Association for Computing and Machinery Student Chapter at BGSU provides an organization for a community of students focused on the advancement of computing as a profession and a science and provides the resources to its members in order to achieve those goals. 

What do we do? 

- We build relationships with employers and coordinate with companies like Owens Corning and Nationwide to bring both workshops and recruiting events to campus. 
- We host a Discord for students in or interested in Computer Science to have a space to socialize and study. 
- We hold dedicated social events with free pizza of course. 
- We host an annual Hackathon where BGSU students can come together and share in their passion for coding and free food as they strive to build amazing projects in a continuous 24 hour period. 
- Most importantly, through social, professional development, and coding oritented events we strive to help better the experience of students interested in Computer Science at BGSU.
