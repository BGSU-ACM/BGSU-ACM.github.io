Happy New Years everyone! To start the year off on the right foot we are happy to announce a major change to our discord community. Our server has been renamed to the BG Computer Science discord. We wanted to make our server more inclusive of all students who are interested in computer science.

As a part of this change we have partnered with *BG Women In Computing* and *Linux club* to make this the hub for computer science students and those who are interested in computing at BGSU. Anyone is welcome to join us through the link below! We hope to see you there.
